# Tire Condition Diagnostic System Using Impedance Measurement

This project implements a simulation of a tire condition diagnostic system using impedance measurement as described in Ucaretron Inc.'s patent application. The system uses impedance sensors to detect tire wear, structural damage, and other potential issues in real-time.

## Overview

This implementation simulates:
- 4 impedance sensors placed at different locations within a tire (tread, sidewall, etc.)
- Real-time impedance data collection at 30-second intervals
- Data preprocessing including noise filtering and temperature compensation
- Anomaly detection using statistical analysis and pattern recognition
- Alert system for different types of tire conditions

## System Architecture

The system consists of several modules:
1. **Data Collection**: Simulates 4 sensors collecting impedance data
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Filters noise and compensates for temperature effects
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies abnormal impedance patterns indicative of tire issues
4. **Alert System**: Generates warnings based on detected anomalies

## Key Features

- **Multi-point Impedance Sensing**: Simulates sensors at different tire locations
- **Dynamic Impedance Analysis**: Detects changes in impedance during operation
- **AI-based Failure Prediction**: Uses pattern analysis to predict tire failures
- **Temperature Compensation**: Adjusts impedance readings based on temperature

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for anomaly detection)

## Usage

Run the simulation:
```
python tire_diagnostic_system.py
```

For visualization:
```
python tire_data_visualization.py
```

## Patent Information
